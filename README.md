# Antman
A program that compressed html and ppm file and decompressed it.

We just need to compile the project by making : make in the root of the directory

Then execute the program to compressed the file : ./antman/antman <b>file number</b>
  
The file is an html file or a ppm image.
  
The number is 1 if the file is an html file and 2 if the file is a ppm.
